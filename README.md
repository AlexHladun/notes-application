# notes-app

Hello, my name is Alex and that's my notes app.

How to start app:

1. Clone my repository.
2. Use `cd back` after that `npm install` after that `npm run dev` for install and start server. Server will be started on localhost:3001. And after that open the new terminal window.
3. Use `cd front` after that `npm install` after that `npm start` for starting client part. Client will be started on localhost:3000
4. Enjoy!
5. For start test go to `cd client` and just run `npm run tests` (REMEMBER: app must be started)
